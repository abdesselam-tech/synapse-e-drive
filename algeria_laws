## 1. Introduction

Obtaining a driving license in Algeria represents a significant milestone for residents and a necessary legal requirement for foreign nationals wishing to operate vehicles within the country's borders. The Algerian driving permit system has undergone substantial evolution over the past two decades, with recent reforms reflecting the nation's commitment to reducing road traffic accidents and improving overall traffic safety standards. Understanding the intricacies of this system is essential for anyone seeking to navigate the licensing process successfully, whether they are first-time applicants, holders of foreign licenses seeking conversion, or professional drivers pursuing advanced certifications.

The regulatory framework governing driving permits in Algeria is primarily established through the fundamental law on road traffic organization, safety, and police, originally enacted as Law 01-14 on August 19, 2001. This legislation has been subject to significant amendments, most notably through Law 17-05 of February 16, 2017, which introduced substantial modifications including the implementation of the point-based permit system and enhanced training requirements [3]. The system continues to evolve, with the Ministry of Interior, Local Authorities, and Transport having recently proposed a comprehensive new Highway Code bill comprising 190 articles, designed to further modernize traffic regulations in response to ongoing road safety challenges [1].

The Algerian approach to driver licensing emphasizes a multi-faceted strategy that combines rigorous theoretical and practical training with ongoing monitoring through the point system. This approach reflects international best practices while accounting for the specific characteristics of Algeria's road network, traffic patterns, and cultural context. The country's position as a Muslim nation also influences certain regulatory aspects, particularly regarding alcohol limitations and related enforcement mechanisms [2][6].

This research document provides exhaustive coverage of all aspects of the Algerian driving permit process, organized to facilitate understanding of the complete pathway from initial enrollment to license issuance and beyond. The information contained herein has been compiled from official government sources, legal documentation, and authoritative secondary sources, ensuring accuracy and reliability for readers seeking comprehensive guidance on this topic.

## 2. Driving Permit Categories and Vehicle Classifications

### 2.1 Overview of Permit Categories

The Algerian driving permit system employs a comprehensive categorization framework that aligns with international standards while addressing the specific vehicle types commonly operated within the country. According to Decree n° 25-169 issued on June 22, 2025, the Algerian driving license system comprises eleven distinct categories, each authorizing the operation of specific vehicle types [5]. This updated framework reflects the government's ongoing efforts to modernize and clarify the licensing structure, ensuring that permit holders clearly understand the vehicles they are legally authorized to operate.

The fundamental principle underlying the Algerian permit system is that every driver must hold a permit corresponding to the category of vehicle they operate. This requirement is explicitly stated in Article 8 of Law 01-2001, which mandates that "tout conducteur de véhicule doit être détenteur d'un permis de conduire afférent au type de véhicule qu'il conduit" (every vehicle driver must hold a driving permit relevant to the type of vehicle they drive) [3]. Violations of this requirement can result in significant penalties, including imprisonment of six months to one year and fines ranging from 20,000 to 50,000 Algerian dinars, along with a one-year prohibition from applying for a permit for other categories [3].

### 2.2 Detailed Category Specifications

The Algerian driving permit categories are structured to provide progressively greater authorization based on vehicle type and purpose. The following comprehensive breakdown details each category and the vehicles it authorizes:

**Category A1** permits the operation of motorcycles with engine displacement greater than 50 cubic centimeters but not exceeding 125 cubic centimeters for thermal engines, or with power not exceeding 15 kilowatts for other motor types [5]. This category also includes tricycles with similar power specifications. The minimum age requirement for Category A1 is 16 years, making it accessible to younger applicants who have demonstrated the necessary competencies. Candidates between 16 and 18 years of age require parental authorization, as the legal majority in Algeria is set at 19 years [5].

**Category A** authorizes the operation of motorcycles with engine displacement exceeding 125 cubic centimeters or power exceeding 15 kilowatts [5]. This category represents the highest level of two-wheeled vehicle authorization and requires applicants to be at least 18 years of age. Like Category A1, candidates under 19 years require parental authorization.

**Category B** permits the operation of passenger and utility vehicles with a gross vehicle weight rating not exceeding 3,500 kilograms, with a maximum capacity of eight passengers plus the driver [5]. This category also authorizes the towing of trailers with a maximum authorized weight not exceeding 750 kilograms, or trailers exceeding this weight provided the combined total does not exceed 3,500 kilograms. The minimum age for Category B is 18 years, making it the standard automobile license sought by most private vehicle operators.

**Category B(E)** extends Category B authorization to include trailers exceeding 750 kilograms, with a combined maximum weight between 3,500 and 4,250 kilograms requiring a specific permit endorsement [5]. The minimum age for this category is 23 years, reflecting the additional skill requirements for towing heavier trailers.

**Category C1** authorizes the operation of trucks with a gross vehicle weight rating between 3,500 and 19,000 kilograms, with trailers not exceeding 750 kilograms [5]. The minimum age requirement is 23 years, acknowledging the professional nature of this category.

**Category C1(E)** extends C1 authorization to include trailers exceeding 750 kilograms, provided the combined weight does not exceed 20,000 kilograms [5]. The minimum age is 23 years.

**Category C** permits the operation of trucks exceeding 19,000 kilograms gross vehicle weight rating, with trailers not exceeding 750 kilograms [5]. The minimum age is 25 years, reflecting the significant responsibilities associated with operating heavy goods vehicles.

**Category C(E)** extends Category C authorization to trailers exceeding 750 kilograms, with no combined weight limit [5]. The minimum age is 25 years.

**Category D** authorizes the operation of vehicles designed to carry more than eight passengers plus the driver, with trailers not exceeding 750 kilograms [5]. This category is essential for professional bus and coach operators, with a minimum age requirement of 25 years.

**Category D(E)** extends Category D authorization to include trailers exceeding 750 kilograms [5]. The minimum age requirement is 25 years.

**Category F** (formerly designated as W) represents a specialized category for vehicles adapted for disabled drivers [5]. This category can authorize vehicles equivalent to Categories A1, A, or B, depending on the specific adaptations required and the driver's capabilities. The minimum age is 16 years for A1-equivalent vehicles and 18 years for A or B-equivalent vehicles.

### 2.3 Category Equivalences and Extensions

The Algerian licensing system recognizes certain equivalences between categories, allowing permit holders to operate additional vehicle types without obtaining separate permits. Under these provisions, any license holder is automatically authorized to operate Category A vehicles [5]. Additionally, holders of Category C permits are authorized to operate C1 vehicles, and holders of C1, C1(E), or D(E) permits are authorized to operate B(E) vehicles [5]. These equivalences reflect the hierarchical nature of the licensing system, where higher-category licenses encompass the privileges of lower categories.

The system also recognizes specific provisions for professional vehicle operations. For instance, a Category B license is sufficient for operating firefighting vehicles regardless of passenger capacity [5], reflecting the emergency service context in which these vehicles operate.

### 2.4 Permit Validity and Renewal Requirements

The validity period for Algerian driving permits varies according to category. Permits for heavy vehicle categories (C1, C1(E), C, C(E), D, D(E)) are valid for five years, while permits for lighter vehicle categories (A1, A, B, B(E), F) are valid for ten years [5]. These validity periods are accompanied by medical examination requirements: heavy category permit holders must undergo medical examinations every five years if under 65 years of age, or every two years if 65 or older [5]. Lighter category permit holders must undergo medical examinations every ten years if under 65, or every five years if 65 or older [5].

## 3. Driving School Enrollment Requirements

### 3.1 Fundamental Eligibility Criteria

Enrollment in a driving school in Algeria requires candidates to satisfy several fundamental eligibility criteria before commencing their training. The primary requirement is age, with the minimum age for most categories set at 18 years [1]. This age requirement reflects the legal adulthood threshold in Algeria for driving-related responsibilities and the assumption of full criminal and civil liability for traffic violations. However, as noted previously, certain categories such as A1 permit operation at 16 years of age, though these younger applicants require parental authorization.

Beyond age requirements, candidates must demonstrate habitual residency in Algeria [1]. This requirement ensures that the driving permit system serves the genuine needs of the Algerian population and prevents exploitation of the licensing system by non-residents. For foreign nationals, a valid residency permit is typically required as proof of lawful presence and intention to remain in the country [1].

Candidates must not be prohibited from driving motor vehicles or mopeds by any existing legal restriction [1]. This includes prohibitions arising from prior license suspensions, medical conditions, or court orders. The authorities maintain records of driving prohibitions, and these are checked during the application process.

### 3.2 Required Documentation

The documentation requirements for driving school enrollment in Algeria are comprehensive, reflecting the government's commitment to maintaining accurate records and preventing fraud. The following documents are typically required:

A valid Algerian national identity card or passport is essential for establishing identity and citizenship [1]. For foreign nationals, a valid passport with appropriate residency documentation is required. The identity document must be current and undamaged, with photographs clearly displaying the applicant's features.

A recent medical certificate issued by an approved medical practitioner is mandatory [1][3]. This certificate must confirm that the applicant possesses the physical and mental fitness required for safe vehicle operation. Medical examinations assess visual acuity, hearing, cardiovascular health, neurological function, and other factors relevant to driving safety. The certificate must be obtained from a public health institution or a private doctor approved by the transport administration [1].

Recent passport-sized photographs, typically four to six copies, are required for application processing and license production [1][5]. These photographs must meet specified standards regarding size, background color, and applicant appearance.

For candidates converting from foreign licenses, a copy of the existing driving license is required, along with an official translation if the license is not in French or Arabic [1]. The translation must be certified by appropriate authorities and clearly indicate the categories of vehicles the foreign license authorizes.

Blood type certification is also required, with the certificate legally authenticated [5]. This information is important for emergency medical response in case of traffic accidents.

### 3.3 Medical Certificate Requirements

The medical certificate represents a critical component of the enrollment process, serving as an official confirmation of the applicant's fitness to drive. Under Algerian regulations, all drivers are subject to periodic mandatory medical control [3]. The examination must be conducted by a qualified medical professional approved by the transport administration, either at a public health institution or through an authorized private practice.

The medical examination encompasses multiple components designed to assess various aspects of physical and mental fitness. Visual assessment includes testing for acuity, field of vision, color perception, and any conditions that might impair safe driving. Auditory testing ensures candidates can perceive warning signals and emergency vehicle sounds. Cardiovascular evaluation checks for conditions that might lead to sudden impairment while driving, such as uncontrolled hypertension or cardiac arrhythmias.

Neurological assessment examines reflexes, coordination, and cognitive function, ensuring candidates can process traffic information and respond appropriately to changing conditions. The examination also screens for conditions that might affect consciousness or decision-making, including epilepsy, diabetes requiring insulin treatment (unless well-controlled and monitored), and substance abuse disorders.

Candidates who fail to undergo required periodic medical examinations face specific penalties. Continuing to drive without completing the mandatory medical control constitutes a contravention punishable under the traffic regulations [3], and such violations are recorded against the driver's point balance.

### 3.4 Registration Process

The registration process at a driving school typically involves several sequential steps. First, candidates must obtain and complete the driver's license application form from the local transport administration office or download it from the Transport Ministry website [1]. This form collects personal information, category of license sought, and declaration of any existing medical conditions or disabilities.

Once the form is completed and supporting documents gathered, candidates submit their applications to the local transport administration office. At this stage, authorities verify the authenticity of submitted documents and conduct background checks to confirm the applicant is not subject to any driving prohibitions. Processing time varies but applicants should expect to wait for document verification before commencing training.

Upon successful registration, candidates receive authorization to begin their theoretical and practical training at an approved driving school. The training program must be completed within a specified timeframe, and candidates must pass both theoretical and practical examinations before receiving their permits.

## 4. Theory Examination Structure

### 4.1 Examination Overview and Format

The theory examination, known locally as the "Code de la Route" or highway code examination, represents the first major hurdle in the Algerian driving permit process. This examination assesses candidates' knowledge of traffic rules, road signs, vehicle operation principles, and safety considerations essential for responsible road use. The examination can be taken in either Arabic or French, allowing candidates to select the language in which they are most comfortable demonstrating their knowledge [5].

The Algerian government has been implementing modernization of the theory examination system, with plans to make it fully digital and expand the question bank to 1,000 questions [1]. This modernization effort aims to improve examination reliability, reduce opportunities for fraud, and provide a more standardized testing experience across different examination centers. The examination system continues to evolve, and candidates should consult current regulations to confirm the exact format applicable at the time of their application.

### 4.2 Examination Content and Topics

The theory examination covers a comprehensive range of topics essential for safe road use. The curriculum is divided into several thematic areas, each contributing to the candidate's overall understanding of traffic rules and safe driving practices.

**Traffic Rules and Regulations**: This component tests knowledge of fundamental traffic regulations, including right-of-way rules, speed limits, passing regulations, and intersection behavior. Candidates must demonstrate understanding of the hierarchical priority system, where vehicles arriving first at an intersection generally have priority, but when simultaneous arrival occurs, the vehicle on the right has priority [2]. Roundabout rules require that ongoing traffic has right-of-way over vehicles attempting to enter [2].

**Road Signs and Markings**: Candidates must demonstrate comprehensive knowledge of the Algerian road sign system, which employs Arabic and French text alongside standardized international symbols [2]. The examination covers regulatory signs (mandatory and prohibitory), warning signs, directional signs, and informational signs. Understanding of road markings, including solid lines prohibiting passing and dashed lines permitting it, is essential.

**Vehicle Operation and Maintenance**: Basic mechanical knowledge is tested, including understanding of vehicle controls, dashboard indicators, and routine maintenance requirements. Candidates must understand how environmental conditions affect vehicle operation and how to respond to common mechanical issues.

**Speed Limits and Their Application**: The examination tests knowledge of Algeria's differentiated speed limits, which vary by road type and vehicle category. Urban areas are limited to 50 kilometers per hour, reduced to 40 kilometers per hour in wet conditions [6]. Rural roads permit 80 kilometers per hour, while highways allow 120 kilometers per hour, reduced to 110 kilometers per hour in wet conditions [6]. New license holders face additional restrictions, being limited to 80 kilometers per hour even on highways [6].

**Alcohol and Impairment Regulations**: Given Algeria's strict approach to drunk driving, candidates must demonstrate thorough understanding of alcohol limits and enforcement. The blood alcohol limit is effectively set at zero tolerance, with 10 milligrams per 100 milliliters of breath permitted only for alcohol resulting from medicinal preparations [2][6]. The examination emphasizes that any detectable alcohol from consumption is prohibited.

### 4.3 Passing Requirements and Scoring

The theory examination requires candidates to demonstrate sufficient knowledge across all tested domains. While specific passing thresholds may vary based on examination format and any recent regulatory changes, the fundamental requirement is that candidates must achieve a satisfactory score demonstrating comprehensive understanding of the tested material.

Candidates who fail the theory examination are typically permitted to retake it after a specified waiting period. This waiting period allows candidates to address knowledge gaps through additional study before attempting the examination again. The system is designed to ensure that all licensed drivers possess adequate theoretical knowledge of traffic rules and safe driving practices, regardless of how many attempts are required.

### 4.4 Special Requirements for Motorcycle Categories

For motorcycle license categories A1 and A2, candidates must complete additional examination components beyond the standard highway code test. Category A1 candidates complete a motorcycle-specific questionnaire supplementing the general theory examination [5]. Category A2 candidates face additional testing, including a plateau test (track driving with figure-8 maneuvers) and an open-circuit driving test [5]. These specialized components assess the unique skills required for safe motorcycle operation, including balance, low-speed control, and emergency maneuvering.

## 5. Practical Driving Test Requirements

### 5.1 Test Structure and Duration

The practical driving test represents the final evaluation of a candidate's ability to operate a vehicle safely in real traffic conditions. Under current regulations, the practical examination duration has been significantly extended from the previous 10 minutes to 30 minutes, aligning the Algerian test with international standards [4]. This extended duration allows examiners to comprehensively assess candidates' skills across a broader range of driving scenarios and conditions.

The practical test is typically conducted on public roads under the supervision of an official examiner from the transport administration. Candidates must demonstrate competency in vehicle control, traffic rule compliance, hazard perception, and safe decision-making throughout the test period. The examiner evaluates not only technical driving skills but also the candidate's attitude and approach to road safety, assessing whether the candidate demonstrates the responsible mindset expected of licensed drivers.

### 5.2 Evaluation Criteria

The practical driving test evaluates multiple competency areas essential for safe road use. Vehicle control encompasses basic maneuvers including starting, stopping, steering, reversing, and parking. Candidates must demonstrate smooth, controlled operation of all vehicle controls, including accelerator, brakes, steering, gears (for manual transmission vehicles), and auxiliary controls such as indicators and lights.

Traffic rule compliance is assessed throughout the test, with examiners observing candidates' adherence to speed limits, proper lane usage, appropriate signaling, and correct behavior at intersections and roundabouts. Candidates must demonstrate understanding of right-of-way principles and apply them correctly when encountering other road users.

Hazard perception represents a critical evaluation component. Candidates must demonstrate awareness of potential hazards, including other vehicles, pedestrians, cyclists, and road conditions, and respond appropriately to emerging dangers. This includes maintaining adequate following distances, adjusting speed to conditions, and anticipating the actions of other road users.

Maneuvering skills are tested through specific exercises, particularly for motorcycle candidates who must complete figure-eight and circuit tests. Automobile candidates may be required to demonstrate parking skills, three-point turns, and other common maneuvers essential for daily driving situations.

### 5.3 Test Administration

Practical driving tests in Algeria are scheduled every 15 days, with a maximum of 10 candidates per driving school per testing session [4]. This controlled approach ensures adequate examiner resources and maintains examination quality standards. The limited candidate numbers per session help ensure that each candidate receives thorough evaluation and that examination conditions remain consistent.

Driving schools are generally closed during August, which affects test scheduling during this period [1]. Candidates should plan their training and testing schedules accordingly, accounting for this annual closure and any other potential scheduling constraints.

### 5.4 Post-Test Procedures

Candidates who successfully complete the practical driving test receive a temporary receipt valid for one month, authorizing driving while the permanent license is being processed [5]. This temporary authorization allows newly-licensed drivers to begin operating vehicles immediately upon passing the test while waiting for license card production and delivery.

Following the one-month temporary period, the probationary license is issued by the Daïra (district-level administrative authority) [5]. This license remains in probationary status for two years, during which the holder is subject to the point system's probationary provisions and any associated restrictions.

## 6. Driving School Curriculum Structure

### 6.1 Training Hour Requirements

The Algerian driving school curriculum has undergone significant enhancement to improve driver competency and road safety outcomes. Effective since April 2016, the total training hour requirement increased substantially from the previous standard of 25-30 hours to a comprehensive 55 hours of instruction [4]. This enhancement reflects the government's recognition that adequate driver training requires substantial time investment and that insufficient training contributes to road accident rates, particularly among newly-licensed drivers.

The 55-hour program is divided into two primary components. Theoretical instruction occupies 25 hours, covering the highway code, traffic rules, vehicle mechanics, and road safety principles [4]. This classroom-based portion ensures candidates develop the knowledge foundation necessary for understanding the reasoning behind traffic rules and making appropriate decisions in novel situations. Practical instruction occupies the remaining 30 hours, during which candidates develop hands-on driving skills on urban roads, highways, and national roads [4].

### 6.2 Theoretical Training Components

The theoretical component of driver training encompasses multiple learning domains designed to produce knowledgeable, safety-conscious drivers. Highway code instruction forms the core of theoretical training, covering all aspects of traffic rules, road signs, markings, and their meanings. Candidates learn the regulatory framework governing road use, including the legal obligations and rights of different road users.

Vehicle mechanics instruction provides candidates with basic understanding of how vehicles function, including engine operation, braking systems, steering mechanisms, and lighting systems. This knowledge enables drivers to understand warning indicators, perform basic troubleshooting, and recognize when vehicles require professional maintenance. Instruction also covers how environmental factors such as temperature, precipitation, and visibility affect vehicle operation.

Road safety education addresses the broader context of driving as a socially responsible activity. Candidates learn about accident causation, risk factors, defensive driving techniques, and the human and economic costs of traffic accidents. This component aims to instill safety-conscious attitudes that persist beyond the training period and influence driving behavior throughout the driver's career.

### 6.3 Practical Training Components

Practical training progresses through multiple stages, beginning with basic vehicle control in closed areas before advancing to public road driving. Initial sessions focus on familiarization with vehicle controls, clutch and gear coordination (for manual transmission vehicles), and smooth acceleration and braking. Candidates develop these fundamental skills in low-stress environments before encountering the complexity of real traffic.

Progressive skill development introduces candidates to increasingly challenging driving situations. Urban driving develops skills in navigating traffic, observing complex signage, managing intersections, and interacting with pedestrians and cyclists. Highway driving introduces higher-speed operation, lane discipline, merging and exiting, and maintaining stability at speed. National road driving combines elements of urban and highway driving while introducing additional hazards such as rural intersections and varied road surface conditions.

The practical training program is designed to expose candidates to the full range of driving conditions they will encounter as licensed drivers. This comprehensive approach ensures graduates can handle normal conditions while developing judgment regarding when to drive cautiously or refrain from driving altogether when conditions are unsuitable.

### 6.4 Instructor Qualifications and School Standards

Driving schools in Algeria must meet specific standards to obtain and maintain operating authorization. The Ministry of Transport oversees driving school regulation, with non-compliant schools facing sanctions [4]. These standards address facility requirements, instructor qualifications, vehicle standards, and administrative procedures.

Driving instructor training in Algeria follows a structured program, with Category B instructor training lasting 15 weeks and comprising 400 hours of instruction [4]. This comprehensive preparation ensures instructors possess both the technical knowledge and pedagogical skills necessary for effective driver education. The program covers vehicle mechanics, traffic rules, instructional techniques, and assessment methodology.

## 7. Algerian Road Signs System

### 7.1 Sign Classification

The Algerian road sign system employs a standardized classification framework that facilitates quick recognition and appropriate response by road users. Road signs in Algeria are displayed in Arabic and French, reflecting the country's bilingual official language policy [2]. This dual-language presentation ensures accessibility for all road users while maintaining consistency with regional practices in North Africa.

The road sign system comprises several functional categories, each serving a distinct purpose in regulating, warning, or informing road users. Regulatory signs establish rules that must be obeyed, warning signs alert drivers to hazards ahead, and informational signs provide guidance about routes, services, and destinations. Each category employs distinctive shapes, colors, and symbols that enable rapid identification even at distance.

### 7.2 Regulatory Signs

Regulatory signs in Algeria include both mandatory signs indicating required actions and prohibitory signs indicating forbidden behaviors. These signs are essential for establishing the rules governing road use at specific locations and under specific conditions.

Mandatory signs typically employ circular designs with blue backgrounds and white symbols, indicating actions that must be taken. Examples include minimum speed requirements, mandatory directions of travel, and requirements for particular vehicle categories. These signs create legal obligations, and violation constitutes a traffic offense subject to penalties.

Prohibitory signs employ circular designs with red borders, indicating actions that are forbidden. Common examples include speed limits, no overtaking zones, no entry restrictions, and vehicle category prohibitions. The penalty system classifies violations of regulatory signs according to their severity, with fourth-degree contraventions (the most serious category) carrying fines of 5,000 Algerian dinars [3].

Priority signs establish the hierarchy of right-of-way at intersections and other conflict points. Stop signs require complete cessation of movement before proceeding, while yield signs require drivers to allow priority to other traffic. The priority sign system reinforces the general rule that when vehicles arrive simultaneously at an intersection, the vehicle on the right has priority [2].

### 7.3 Warning Signs

Warning signs employ triangular designs with red borders, alerting drivers to hazards that require heightened attention or adjusted driving behavior. These signs provide advance warning of conditions such as curves, intersections, pedestrian crossings, animal crossings, and road surface changes.

Curve signs indicate upcoming changes in road alignment, prompting drivers to adjust speed appropriately. Intersection signs alert drivers to upcoming junctions where other traffic may be encountered. Pedestrian crossing signs warn of designated crossing areas where pedestrians have priority. Animal crossing signs, particularly relevant in rural areas, indicate locations where livestock or wildlife may enter the roadway.

Temporary warning signs, often employing orange backgrounds rather than the standard white, indicate temporary conditions such as road works, accidents, or diversion routes. These signs require particular attention as they alert drivers to situations that may not be familiar from previous experience using the road.

### 7.4 Information and Directional Signs

Information signs provide essential details about road conditions, services, and regulations affecting road users. These signs employ various designs depending on their specific purpose, typically using rectangular formats with appropriate color coding.

Directional signs employ green backgrounds for highway destinations and blue backgrounds for general information, providing route guidance to drivers. These signs list destinations, distances, and sometimes travel times, enabling drivers to navigate effectively. The sign system includes provincial border signs, kilometer markers, and street signs to support route finding.

Highway-specific signs address the particular requirements of controlled-access roads, including entrance and exit signs, distance markers, and service area notifications. Highway signs in Algeria follow international conventions while incorporating local destination information relevant to the national road network.

## 8. Key Algerian Driving Laws and Regulations

### 8.1 Point-Based Permit System

One of the most significant features of the Algerian driving regulatory framework is the point-based permit system, introduced through Law 17-05 of 2017. Under this system, every driving permit is affected by a capital of 24 points, representing the maximum number of points available to a fully compliant driver [3]. This system operates as both an incentive for safe driving and a mechanism for identifying and addressing problem drivers.

New license holders begin with a reduced capital of 12 points during a mandatory two-year probationary period [3]. This probationary phase subjects new drivers to stricter consequences for violations, recognizing their higher risk profile during the initial driving experience period. If a probationary driver loses all points, they must complete a mandatory formation (training course) at their own expense to reconstitute their point balance [3].

Point loss occurs through specific traffic violations according to a graduated scale. First-degree contraventions result in one-point loss, second-degree contraventions in two-point loss, third-degree contraventions in four-point loss, and fourth-degree contraventions in six-point loss [3]. Delictual offenses (more serious violations) result in ten-point loss [3]. Multiple violations committed simultaneously result in cumulative point loss, up to a maximum of half the definitive point capital (12 points from the full 24-point allocation) [3].

Point reconstitution occurs through two mechanisms: either through a period of violation-free driving or through completion of an authorized training course at the driver's expense [3]. The specific period required for automatic point recovery is established through regulatory provisions, while the training option provides an accelerated recovery pathway for drivers who prefer this approach.

### 8.2 Speed Limit Regulations

Speed limits in Algeria are differentiated according to road type and vehicle category, reflecting the varying safety considerations associated with different driving environments. The standard limits are 50 kilometers per hour in urban areas, 80 kilometers per hour on rural roads, and 120 kilometers per hour on highways [2][6]. In wet conditions, these limits are reduced to 40, 80, and 110 kilometers per hour respectively [6].

Special speed restrictions apply to certain vehicle categories and driver populations. New license holders, during their two-year probationary period, face an 80-kilometer-per-hour maximum limit regardless of road type [2][6]. This restriction recognizes the elevated risk profile of inexperienced drivers and aims to reduce accidents during the critical initial driving period.

Speed limit violations are classified according to the degree of excess, with graduated penalties. Exceeding the limit by 10 percent or less constitutes a second-degree contravention, while exceeding by more than 10 percent but less than 20 percent is classified as third-degree [3]. Exceeding by 20 to 30 percent triggers fourth-degree contravention penalties, while exceeding by 30 percent or more constitutes a delictual offense with enhanced penalties [3]. These classifications ensure proportionate consequences reflecting the increased risk associated with greater speed excess.

### 8.3 Alcohol and Impairment Regulations

Algeria enforces a strict approach to alcohol-impaired driving, reflecting both road safety concerns and cultural factors related to the country's Islamic heritage. The blood alcohol concentration limit is effectively set at zero tolerance for consumed alcohol, with a technical threshold of 10 milligrams per 100 milliliters of breath permitted only for alcohol resulting from medicinal preparations [2][6]. This means that any detectable alcohol from beverage consumption results in violation.

The enforcement framework includes provision for alcohol testing through breath analysis devices. Drivers suspected of alcohol impairment may be required to submit to testing, and refusal to cooperate constitutes an offense. The penalties for alcohol-impaired driving include significant fines, license suspension or revocation, and potential imprisonment for serious offenses.

Beyond alcohol, the regulations address other forms of impairment including drug influence and severe fatigue. The use of handheld mobile phones while driving is prohibited, with the prohibition extending to hands-free devices in some interpretations [2][6]. This prohibition recognizes the cognitive distraction caused by phone use, even when physical handling is not required.

### 8.4 Safety Equipment Requirements

Algerian law mandates specific safety equipment that vehicles must carry and that occupants must use. Seatbelt use is compulsory for all vehicle occupants, including rear-seat passengers [2][3]. This requirement applies to all vehicle categories, though certain exceptions may exist for specific vehicle types and situations. The penalty for non-compliance includes fine provisions, with seatbelt violations classified as first-degree contraventions [3].

For motorcycle and moped riders, helmet use is mandatory for both drivers and passengers [3]. This requirement reflects the particular vulnerability of two-wheeled vehicle users to head injuries in accidents. Helmet standards and certification requirements may apply, ensuring that protective headgear provides adequate impact protection.

Child safety provisions restrict the transport of children under 10 years of age in front seats [3]. Children in this age group must be properly restrained in rear seats using appropriate child restraint systems. The driver bears responsibility for ensuring these requirements are met, and violations result in penalties.

Vehicles operating on Algerian roads must carry specific equipment including warning triangles and reflective vests [2]. These items enable drivers to safely respond to breakdowns and accidents by providing warning to approaching traffic and enhancing driver visibility when outside the vehicle.

### 8.5 Priority and Right-of-Way Rules

The Algerian right-of-way system establishes clear priorities for resolving conflicts between road users. The fundamental principle holds that a vehicle arriving first at an intersection or junction has priority over vehicles arriving subsequently [2]. This first-come-first-served approach provides a simple baseline rule that drivers can apply when no other priority indicators are present.

When vehicles arrive at an intersection simultaneously, the vehicle positioned on the right has priority over the vehicle on the left [2]. This supplementary rule resolves the limited number of cases where the arrival order cannot establish clear priority. Drivers approaching such situations should be prepared to yield to vehicles on their right.

Roundabouts present specific priority rules where vehicles already circulating within the roundabout have priority over vehicles seeking to enter [2]. This approach maintains the continuous flow of traffic within the roundabout while requiring entering vehicles to wait for suitable gaps. Vehicles leaving roundabouts must signal their intentions and yield to any vehicles they cross.

Emergency vehicles always have priority over other traffic when operating in emergency mode [2]. Drivers must yield appropriately and not obstruct the progress of emergency vehicles. Special lanes or shoulders may be used by emergency vehicles, and regular traffic must not impede these movements.

### 8.6 Penalties and Enforcement Framework

The Algerian traffic enforcement framework classifies violations into four degrees of contravention plus a separate category of delictual offenses. This graduated classification enables proportionate response to varying levels of violation severity.

First-degree contraventions carry fixed fines of 2,000 Algerian dinars and result in one-point loss for most violations [3]. These relatively minor violations include equipment deficiencies, documentation issues, and certain pedestrian-related offenses.

Second-degree contraventions carry fixed fines of 2,500 Algerian dinars and result in two-point loss [3]. These violations include excessive sound device use, improper use of reserved lanes, improper speed reduction, and certain vehicle equipment violations.

These serious violations include improper direction of travel, intersection and priority violations, improper passing and crossing, failure to stop at stop signs, prohibited maneuvers on highways, and acceleration to prevent being overtaken.

Delictual offenses represent the most serious traffic violations and carry criminal penalties including imprisonment, alongside ten-point loss from the permit [3].

## 10. Conclusion

The Algerian driving permit process represents a comprehensive regulatory framework designed to ensure that licensed drivers possess the knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary for safe road use. The system's multiple components—from the detailed category structure and rigorous training requirements to the point-based monitoring system—work together to promote road safety while providing clear pathways for individuals to obtain driving privileges.

The evolution of the Algerian driving regulatory framework continues, with proposed new legislation aimed at further strengthening road safety measures. The draft Highway Code bill comprising 190 articles reflects ongoing commitment to addressing road safety challenges through enhanced education, training, and deterrence mechanisms [1]. This legislative development, combined with the existing point system and enhanced training requirements, demonstrates Algeria's systematic approach to improving road safety outcomes.

For prospective drivers, understanding this framework is essential for navigating the licensing process successfully and becoming responsible, law-abiding road users. The comprehensive nature of the training and examination requirements, while demanding, ensures that licensed drivers have demonstrated competency across the full range of knowledge and skills required for safe driving. The point system and periodic medical requirements provide ongoing monitoring to maintain driving standards throughout a driver's career.

For foreign nationals, the Algerian system requires attention to documentation requirements, language considerations for examinations, and the validity period limitations on foreign licenses. Conversion to an Algerian license within the permitted timeframe is essential for continued legal driving, and understanding the specific requirements for foreign license holders facilitates this transition.

The road sign system, while employing standardized international symbols, requires specific knowledge of the Algerian variant to ensure proper interpretation and compliance. The enforcement framework, with its graduated penalty system, provides proportionate consequences for violations while the point system enables identification and intervention with high-risk drivers.

As Algeria continues to develop and modernize its road infrastructure and traffic management systems, the driving permit framework will likely continue to evolve. Prospective drivers and licensed operators should remain current with regulatory developments to ensure ongoing compliance and safe road use. The investment required to obtain an Algerian driving permit—in terms of time, effort, and financial resources—reflects the seriousness with which the country approaches road safety and the responsibility inherent in operating motor vehicles on public roads.
